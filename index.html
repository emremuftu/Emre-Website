            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The emergence of microfinance in the late 90s and early 2000s sparked tremendous excitement as a revolutionary solution for poverty alleviation whose implementation would pull millions out of poverty. The UN General Assembly described 2005 as “the International Year of Microcredit.” Twenty years later, poverty, although lower, is still very prevalent throughout the developing world. For numerous researchers in the field, microfinance has not lived up to its early promise as a unifying solution for poverty eradication. In fact, microfinance researchers and institutions have received scrutiny from governments and economists alike. Although microcredit has been shown in a dearth of research to improve living conditions for borrowers, the debate in terms of efficacy still remains unresolved.
Although the policy debate continues, there are countless accounts of evidence that overall microfinance (MF) creates more good outcomes than bad outcomes, especially considering short-run effects and when targeting specific borrowers (UNU-WIDER, 2021). However, simply stating that most loan recipients experience pareto improvement is insufficient to justify MF as a poverty alleviation tool. </p>

            <p>Capital constraints are characterized as hindering the growth stage of many microfinance institutions (MFIs). Without investment from traditional financial institutions, many MFIs experience anemic growth and trouble remaining sustainable (Alexis, 2023; Bogan, 2012). To truly justify and attract greater investment from governments and financial institutions, it’s essential to understand how MF impacts the broader economy.</p>
