            <h2>Microfinance Data</h2>
            <p>The data set comprises panel data for 78 developing nations as well as China, Finland and Russia between 2004 and 2022. In total there are 9 variables recorded for each country every year, this creates a data shape of 1558 samples by 10 columns. Although the data set includes data for a few developed nations, the target population is low - middle developed economies with a unit of observation of countries. All data used in the analysis is sourced from the World Bank. Data sets utilized include the World Bank Financial Access Survey (FAS), World Bank National Accounts, World Development Indicators,  and the Worldwide Governance Indicators. The FAS data set is based on financial indicators from Central Banks and MFI regulators of 189 nations, the data is collected by the IMF but is also published by the World Bank, it spans from 2004 to 2022. The World Governance Indicator data set is measured with surveys completed by firms, individuals and regulators to create indicators which reflect the “openness” of governance. These survey scores are then aggregated and normalized with an Unobserved Component Model to create ranks for individual nations in different areas of governance. World Bank National Accounts and World Development Indicators data is collected through Central Banks and regulatory institutions and reported by the World Bank.</p>
